# How to contribute

Third-party patches are essential for keeping Open-Source software awesome.
We simply can't think of all circumstances and myriad configurations for
building and running our software.

### Development

We're an open and flexible team of developers and don't force anyone into a strict workflow.
Just make sure that your editor or IDE has a proper syntax-highlighter and linter.
Pull-Requests with syntax errors will be rejected.
**Also PLEASE check that your editor doesn't `gofmt` the code on save**.
We use their coding-style but have 4 spaces instead of tabs.

Recommended IDE's are:
- Jetbrains Gogland
- IntelliJ IDEA
- VS-Code
- Sublime Text 3

We can't help you with this topic though.<br>
***Please don't start working on features before you figured out a workflow that works for you.***

### Requirements

- Hardware
    - A 64bit CPU
    - CPU-Support for AVX2, AVX or SSE3+ instructions is a plus but not (yet) mandatory
- OS
    - Any recent Linux Distro, Windows 7+ or macOS 10.9+
- Shell
    - BASH 4.0 or newer
    - Alternatively any BASH 4.0 compatible shell (like ZSH)
- Software
    -  [git](http://git-scm.com) (Version 2.0 or newer)
    -  [Go](http://golang.org) (Version 1.7 or newer)
- Mandatory Tools
    - [go-bindata](https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata)
    - [Glide](https://glide.sh/)

If you're a Windows user you need to setup a UNIX-like environment.<br>
That means installing a software like [MINGW](http://www.mingw.org/) or [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/)
and using BASH instead of CMD or PowerShell.
Main development takes place in unix-like environments so we can't help you setting up a windows environment.

***WARNING:*** There are known bugs of Go's `/dev/stdin` reader on Windows.<br>
You ***cannot*** develop any music/audio related parts of karen.

<br>

***PLEASE NOTE:*** <br>
Do **NOT** use the "classic" POSIX Shell (`sh`).<br>
Our scripts use advanced parameter-expansion and the double-braced `if` condition (`[[ <condition> ]];`) <br>
and those features are not supported below bash.

## Getting Started

* Submit an issue that describes you problem or idea, assuming one does not already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue/idea including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue if you're reporting a bug.
* ***WAIT*** until someone tells you that we approve your feature request or bug report.

## Getting the code

* Make sure that the folder `$GOPATH/src/code.lukas.moe/x` exists
* Fork the repository
* Clone the repository to `$GOPATH/src/code.lukas.moe/x/karen`
    * This is needed to avoid namespacing issues with Go's compiler.
* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is usually the master branch.
  * Only target release/production branches if you are certain your fix must be on that branch and talked about that with us.
  * To quickly create a topic branch based on master do a `git checkout -b feature/my_awesome_feature`.
  * Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch. Your request might be rejected otherwise.

## Installing dependencies

The depdencies are currently managed with [Glide](https://glide.sh/).
It's a tool that works just like npm, cargo, composer and all the other fancy dependency managers - but for go.
It's actually a wrapper around Go's vendoring feature but adds critical features like version locking.

After installing it just `cd` into Karen's folder and run `glide install`.

## Making changes
* Make commits of logical units to make rebasing/merging/reviewing easier for us.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace changes with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format and not too long.
* Your commit message must not exceed 120 chars.
    * Rule of thumb: Short title, long explanation in body.
* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
* Run _all_ the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.
* Build Karen and test the commands on Karen's Sandbox or private guilds.

## Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork.
* Submit a merge request.
* The core team looks at Merge Requests on a regular basis.<br>
  Please don't spam comments like `Please merge this already!!!`.<br>
  We will merge it when we think it's time to do so.<br>
  Excessive spamming increases the chances that we reject your request.<br>
  You will get an email when your request was accepted.
* Feedback will be given if necessary<br>
That means we will annotate your code if we see bugs or if you don't use our style-guidelines properly.
* After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. 
* After two weeks we may close the merge request if it isn't showing any activity.
    * The interval can be expanded if you tell us what's going on. Everyone here has a real-life and understands that
      "having time" is pretty uncommon when having a job and/or family.
