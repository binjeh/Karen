### Invite
Public invite link is coming after the private beta ends.

Want access?<br>
Register here: https://goo.gl/forms/9J9GYMg8c9IM6a5Z2

### Can I `go get` this bot?
Short answer: No you can't.

Long answer:<br>
No you can't because `go get` sucks.

Huge projects like this need proper version locking.<br>
gopkg.in is a nice try but not good enough.<br>

I use https://glide.sh

### Can I `go build` this bot?
Short answer: No you can't.

Long answer:<br>
No you can't because `go build` sucks.

We use CMake, GNU Make and some shell magic instead.

Thus this is most likely the only go-project on earth that supports c-style macros in comments and conditional compilation.<br>
Are we awesome yet?

### Can you help me self-hosting Karen?
No.<br>
There will be neither guides nor setup help.<br>
The code is provided for transparency and community-contributions only.
<br>
If you decide to fork Karen remember to comply with the [LICENSE](https://github.com/sn0w/karen/blob/master/LICENSE).

### Why are you saying `high performance` all the time?
Why do we live in a time where it's acceptable that an EMPTY Java class consumes 10mb RAM?<br>
Why does no one care about optimizing anymore?

That's why I'm building Karen.<br>
I want to create a bot that:

 - Can handle an almost infinite amount of joined guilds
 - Is able to scale vertically **and** horizontally
 - Can play music for free, forever. (Not like that freemium stuff Mee6 does)
 - Will **never** use more resources than absolutely needed
 - Never crashes (or to be precise: be able to recover from almost any `panic()`)

### Achievements

- Never exceeded 2% CPU usage at the time of writing.
- Never used more than 8MB of it's allocated heap.

### Docs
Hancrafted guide soon (tm)

Until then use GoWalker/GoDoc for coding guides and
the homepage for usage help.

### Disclaimer
This bot is still in a early stage.<br>
Please expect (rare) crashes and minor performance problems until the bot is mature enough.
